This is a simple start to a 2d game.
To run please install the dependencies and run python3 app.py.
Then navigate to the locally hosted webpage using chrome because safari doesn't work with that app.
You can open multiple webpages and each should generate a new player in the same map at a random location.
You can move your player around by pressing the wasd keys.
